---

## 🔴 Vulnerability Summary

**CVE-2025-55182**: Critical remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Under certain conditions, specially crafted requests could lead to unintended remote code execution

---

## 📊 Affected Versions (BEFORE FIX)

| Package | Vulnerable Version | Fixed Version |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Next.js** | 15.5.4 ❌ | 15.5.7 ✅ |
| **React** | 19.1.0 ❌ | 19.1.2 ✅ |
| **React DOM** | 19.1.0 ❌ | 19.1.2 ✅ |

---

## ✅ Resolution Applied

### Changes Made to `package.json`:

```json
// BEFORE (Vulnerable)
"next": "15.5.4",
"react": "19.1.0",
"react-dom": "19.1.0"

// AFTER (Patched)
"next": "15.5.7",
"react": "19.1.2",
"react-dom": "19.1.2"
```

### Commands Executed:

```bash
# 1. Updated package.json with patched versions
npm install

# 2. Fixed additional moderate vulnerabilities (js-yaml, tar)
npm audit fix

# 3. Verified no vulnerabilities remain
npm audit
# Result: found 0 vulnerabilities ✅

# 4. Confirmed build works with patched versions
npm run build
# Result: Build successful ✅
```

---

## 🔍 Verification

### Version Check:
```bash
$ npm list react react-dom next --depth=0

interview-app@0.1.0
├── next@15.5.7      ✅
├── react@19.1.2     ✅
└── react-dom@19.1.2 ✅
```

### Security Audit:
```bash
$ npm audit

found 0 vulnerabilities ✅
```

### Build Status:
```bash
$ npm run build

▲ Next.js 15.5.7
✓ Compiled successfully ✅
```

---

## 🛡️ What Was Fixed

### React Server Components Hardening

The patched versions include:
- **Hardened handling of user inputs** to prevent unintended behavior
- **Protection against remote code execution** via specially crafted requests
- **Improved validation** of React Server Components payloads

### Affected Components:
- `react-server-dom-webpack`
- `react-server-dom-turbopack`
- `react-server-dom-parcel`

These are internal to Next.js and are now using the patched versions.

## 🔐 Additional Security Improvements

While fixing CVE-2025-55182, we also resolved:

1. **js-yaml** (moderate) - Prototype pollution vulnerability
2. **tar** (moderate) - Race condition leading to uninitialized memory exposure

Both fixed via `npm audit fix`.
