# Pre-Deployment Checklist

Complete checklist for deploying the post-interview credit deduction system.

## 1. Database Migration

### Update Production Database

```bash
# Push schema changes to production
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss

# Or create migration (preferred for production)
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_post_interview_credits
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**New Fields Added:**

- `Interview.creditsPlanned` - Credits user planned to spend
- `Interview.creditsDeducted` - Credits actually deducted
- `Interview.endedBy` - Who/what ended interview ("user", "agent", "system", "error")
- `Interview.chargeDecision` - "charged" or "not_charged"
- `Interview.chargeReason` - Human-readable reason for decision

---

## 2. Environment Variables

### Required New Variables

Add these to your production environment (Vercel, etc.):

```env
# OpenAI (for interview classification)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Existing variables (verify they're set)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

### Production Configuration

1. **Switch to Live Mode** in Stripe Dashboard

2. **Get Live API Keys:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
   - Copy **Live Secret Key** → `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - Copy **Live Publishable Key** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

3. **Create Products** (if not already in live mode):
   - 5 Credits - $5 (one-time)
   - 10 Credits - $10 (one-time)
   - 50 Credits - $50 (one-time)
   - Copy Price IDs → `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_5`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_10`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_50`

4. **Set Up Production Webhook:**

## 6. AWS S3 Lifecycle Rules

### Configure Automatic Video Deletion

**Important:** Videos are auto-deleted after 7 days using S3 Lifecycle Rules (no code changes needed).

1. **Go to AWS S3 Console:**
   - https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/

2. **Select Your Bucket:**
   - Find: `your-interview-recordings-bucket`

3. **Create Lifecycle Rule:**
   - Management → Lifecycle rules → Create rule
   - **Rule name:** `delete-old-interviews`
   - **Prefix:** `interviews/` (to only affect interview videos)
   - **Actions:**
     - ✅ Delete expired object delete markers
     - ✅ Delete previous versions
   - **Expiration:**
     - Delete objects: `7 days` after creation
   - Create rule

**Verify:**

- [ ] Lifecycle rule created
- [ ] Applies to `interviews/` prefix
- [ ] Deletion set to 7 days
- [ ] Rule is enabled

---

## 7. Cron Job Setup

### Schedule Interview Cleanup

**If using Vercel:**

1. **Add Cron Job** in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/check-expiring-interviews",
      "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Deploy** to activate cron

**If using another platform:**

**Vercel Cron Job (Automatic):**

The `vercel.json` file configures automatic daily cleanup:
- Runs at 2 AM UTC daily
- Sends warning emails 24h before expiration
- Deletes expired interview records (videos auto-delete via S3)

**Setup Steps:**

1. Set `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel Environment Variables:
   ```bash
   # Generate a secret
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. Add to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
   - Name: `CRON_SECRET`
   - Value: Your generated secret
   - Environments: Production, Preview, Development

3. Deploy - Vercel automatically registers the cron job from `vercel.json`

**Test Checklist:**

- [ ] `CRON_SECRET` set in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] `vercel.json` deployed to production
- [ ] Cron job appears in Vercel Dashboard → Cron Jobs tab
- [ ] Test endpoint manually: 
  ```bash
  curl -X GET https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/check-expiring-interviews \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
  ```

**See:** `docs/infrastructure/CRON_JOB_SETUP.md` for detailed setup and troubleshooting

## 8. Agent Deployment

### Deploy Python Agent

**If using LiveKit Cloud:**

1. **Build and deploy agent:**

```bash
cd /Users/justinkroeger/agent-starter-python
# Follow LiveKit deployment docs
```

2. **Verify environment variables in agent:**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
TAVUS_REPLICA_ID=...
TAVUS_PERSONA_ID=...
RAGIE_API_KEY=...
AWS_S3_BUCKET=...
AWS_S3_REGION=...
```

**If self-hosted:**

Ensure agent has access to all required env vars and can reach your Next.js API at:

- `https://yourdomain.com/api/interviews/session-report`

## 9. Testing Before Launch

### Critical Tests

**1. Full Purchase Flow:**

```
✓ Buy credits with real card
✓ Credits appear immediately
✓ Transaction in Stripe Dashboard
✓ Webhook delivered successfully
```

**2. Interview Start (No Deduction):**

```
✓ Start interview with 10 credits
✓ Interview starts successfully
✓ Credits NOT deducted yet
✓ Database shows creditsPlanned=10, creditsDeducted=null
```

**3. Interview End - User Ends (>50%):**

```
✓ Complete 6+ minutes of 10-minute interview
✓ Click "Hang Up"
✓ Wait for session report processing
✓ Credits deducted (10)
✓ chargeDecision="charged"
✓ User balance decreased by 10
```

**4. Interview End - Technical Failure:**

```
✓ Start interview
✓ Disconnect after 15 seconds
✓ Wait for session report
✓ Credits NOT deducted
✓ chargeDecision="not_charged"
✓ chargeReason shows "too short"
```

**5. Email Notifications:**

```
✓ Complete interview
✓ Receive "Report Ready" email
✓ Check 24h warning email (may need to manually test)
```

**6. OpenAI Classification:**

```
✓ Check logs for classification results
✓ Verify AI is analyzing transcripts
✓ Confirm charge decisions make sense
```

## 10. Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Watch

**First Week:**

- Monitor charge rate (should be 70-85%)
- Check classification reasons
- Watch for unusual patterns
- Monitor OpenAI API costs

**SQL Queries for Monitoring:**

```sql
-- Charge rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE "chargeDecision" = 'charged') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as charge_rate,
  COUNT(*) as total_interviews
FROM "Interview"
WHERE "creditsDeducted" IS NOT NULL;

-- Common reasons for not charging
SELECT "chargeReason", COUNT(*) as count
FROM "Interview"
WHERE "chargeDecision" = 'not_charged'
GROUP BY "chargeReason"
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Average duration by decision
SELECT
  "chargeDecision",
  AVG("duration") as avg_duration_seconds,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM "Interview"
WHERE "creditsDeducted" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "chargeDecision";
```

---

## 11. Rollback Plan

### If Something Goes Wrong

**Emergency Disable:**

1. **Revert to pre-deduction** (temporary fix):
   - Set feature flag in code or env var
   - Deploy old version

2. **Manual credit refunds** (if needed):

```sql
-- Find affected users
SELECT * FROM "Interview"
WHERE "chargeDecision" = 'charged'
  AND "creditsDeducted" > 0
  AND "createdAt" > '2025-12-18';  -- Today's date

-- Manually refund credits (run in transaction)
BEGIN;

-- Add credits back
UPDATE "User"
SET "credits" = "credits" + 10
WHERE "id" = 'user_id_here';

-- Create refund ledger entry
INSERT INTO "CreditLedger" (
  "id", "userId", "amount", "balance", "type",
  "description", "referenceId", "createdAt"
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'user_id_here',
  10,
  (SELECT "credits" FROM "User" WHERE "id" = 'user_id_here'),
  'refund',
  'Refund: Post-interview credit system issue',
  'interview_id_here',
  NOW()
);

COMMIT;
```
