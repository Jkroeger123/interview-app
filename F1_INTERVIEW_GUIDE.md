## Legal Framework

### INA §214(b) - Presumption of Immigrant Intent

**Core Principle**: All F-1 visa applicants are **presumed to be intending immigrants** until they prove otherwise.

**Burden of Proof**: On the applicant to demonstrate:
- Temporary intent to study in the U.S.
- Strong ties to home country that compel return
- Sufficient financial resources for entire program
- Legitimate academic purpose

**Standard for Denial**: Failure to overcome the presumption results in refusal under INA §214(b). There is **no appeal process**.

### Key Regulatory References
- **9 FAM 402.5**: F-1 visa adjudication standards
- **9 FAM 302.1**: Residence abroad requirement
- **INA §101(a)(15)(F)**: F-1 nonimmigrant definition
- **8 CFR 214.2(f)**: F-1 student regulations

### Consular Officer Authority
- Interviews typically last **2-5 minutes**
- Officer has **broad discretionary authority**
- Assessment based on **totality of circumstances**
- **Credibility** is paramount—coaching/fraud indicators lead to immediate denial

## Common Wrong Answers

| Question | Wrong Answer | Why It's a Problem |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|

| **What is your major?** | "I don't know exactly, maybe computers?" | Lack of clarity or preparation |
| **Who is paying for your education?** | "My uncle in the U.S. might help." | Vague, unstable funding |
| **What will you do after graduation?** | "I'll see if I can get a job and stay." | Immigrant intent |
| **Do you have a job waiting at home?** | "No, I don't plan to go back soon." | Weak home country ties |
| **Have you been refused a visa before?** | "No" (when they have) | Misrepresentation—permanent ineligibility |

| **Have you paid the SEVIS fee?** | "What's that?" | Lack of preparation |
| **Explain your program in English** | "I don't really understand it yet." | Poor academic preparation |
